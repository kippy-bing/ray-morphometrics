# Ray Morphometrics Analysis

A collaborative project to standardize the analysis of morphological data for electric rays (Torpediniformes) and thornback rays (Rajidae).

This repository contains scripts and datasets for reproducible morphometric analysis, focusing on species like *Torpedo marmorata* (marbled electric ray) and *Raja clavata* (thornback ray).

## Project Goals

- Standardize measurement protocols for ray morphology
- Develop reproducible analysis scripts in Python
- Facilitate collaboration among marine biologists studying elasmobranch morphology
- Provide open-access datasets for comparative studies

## Current Features

- Sample dataset of morphological measurements (total length, disc width, weight)
- Python script for calculating disc width ratio (disc_width / total_length)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository
2. Install Python dependencies (if any)
3. Run `analysis.py` to calculate disc width ratios

## Data

The `data/` directory contains sample measurements in CSV format. Measurements are in centimeters (cm) and weight in kilograms (kg).
